Figure out what to do with:
	bhop_winter_fix,2688471,822439,3d19b027307bbce87b8d52bd4b10c884858df0d3

	bhop_sky_6xl,27040497,9583332,c14e9d58dcd4093ed65fd92c0eebf0919ce90d7c
		- Adds lighting so it's not fullbright
	bhop_platinum_fix
		- Two different ports
	kz_crate_delight
		- Two different ports. Might need to be packed.
	kz_crate_delight
		- Two different ports. One needs to be packed
	kz_kzro_communityblock

	kz_mix_multitude
		- varying amount of unpacked-ness
